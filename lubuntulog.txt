Installing nvidia-current through apt.
  This fixed the failure to suspend problem.
Installed dropbox via website download and then python-gpgme via apt.

--Overtone
  Installing via apt:
    -Supercollider, jack-tools, ant, fftw3, qjackct1
      - fftw3 not found, installing cl-fftw3 instead

Added line "set completion-ignore-case on" to /etc/inputrc to disable
bash completion case sensitivity.

Made a symbolic link in /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ from libudev.so.1 to
libudev.so.0 to get LightTable to start.

Installing lubuntu-restricted-extras through apt.  (mainly for flash).

Installing yakuake drop down terminal.

Installed ppa:bumblebee/stable, bumblebee, virtualgl,
  linux-headers-generic

Modified /etc/rc.init by changing this line:
  exit 0
    to
  echo 0 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
to try to get lubuntu to remember brightness settings on reboot.

Installed intel powertop software and everything that was required.
  https://01.org/powertop/

Had to make another symbolic link from
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 to /usr/lib64/libudev.so.0 for
LightTable to work again.

Installed xbacklight and modified lubunturc.xml to map A-F2 and A-F3
to decrement and increment the screen brightness respectively at a step
much smaller than fn-F2/fn-F3.

Wrote dim and undim scripts that can change brightness independent of
regular brightness settings.  This allows for an infinite gradient
between pure black and 100% brightness.
